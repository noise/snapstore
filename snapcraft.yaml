description: |
  snapstore is a minimalist example of a "store" for snaps, based on the public
  API specs (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppStore/Interfaces/ClickPackageIndex). It
  allows anyone to host their own collection of snaps for installation on
  supported platforms.

  See http://snapcraft.io for more information on creating and using snap
  packages.
